# 🚀 Code Generation & Boilerplate Reduction Libraries in Java

This document outlines popular Java libraries that help reduce boilerplate code and improve development productivity through compile-time code generation.

---

## ⚠️ Important Considerations

While these libraries can dramatically boost development speed, **they come with trade-offs**. Before using them in production, consider the following:

- 🛠 **IDE Support**: Some libraries (e.g., Lombok, Manifold) rely heavily on IDE plugins, which may not be fully supported across all environments.
- 🔍 **Debugging Difficulty**: Generated code can be hidden, making stack traces and debugging harder to follow.
- 🔄 **Build Tool Compatibility**: Extra configuration may be needed in Maven, Gradle, or other build tools.
- 📚 **Learning Curve**: Team members may need time to understand library-specific annotations and behaviors.
- 🔒 **Vendor Lock-In**: Over-reliance on certain libraries can make migration or refactoring more difficult.

> ✨ **Best Practice:** Always evaluate the long-term maintainability and ecosystem compatibility before adopting code-generation libraries.

## 🧱 Code Generation & Boilerplate Reduction

> These libraries help minimize repetitive coding by automatically generating commonly used patterns like builders, mappers, and accessors.

### 📦 `record-builder`
Generates builder classes for [Java records](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/language/records.html), providing an easy and fluent way to create immutable objects.

### 📦 `lombok`
Widely used to reduce boilerplate in Java classes by using annotations to auto-generate:
- Getters/setters
- Constructors
- `equals()`, `hashCode()`, and `toString()`
- Builders and more

> **Note:** Requires IDE support for full productivity, which may not be available or reliable in all environments.

### 📦 `mapstruct`
A compile-time mapper framework that automatically generates type-safe and performant Java bean mappings.

Use it to convert between DTOs, entities, and other POJOs without writing repetitive mapping code.

### 📦 `manifold`
Extends the Java compiler with powerful enhancements, such as:
- Type-safe reflection
- Extension methods
- Structural typing
- Code generation via type manifolds

Useful for metaprogramming, API enhancements, and compile-time type safety.
