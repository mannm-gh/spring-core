# Tight vs. Loose Coupling

- Simple vs. Complex
- Low vs. High Extensibility
- Low vs. High Development Effort?

## Characteristics of Loose Coupling
- Components communicate with each other through well-defined contracts
- Each component has limited knowledge of the others

## Definition

**Loose coupling** in software design refers to a **design principle** where individual components or modules have **minimal knowledge of and dependencies on each other**. This means that changes in one component are **less likely to break or impact** other components.

---

## Pros
- ✅ **Easier to maintain**: You can change or replace parts of the system without affecting others.
- ✅ **Improved testability**: Components can be tested in isolation (e.g., with mocks).
- ✅ **Better reusability**: Modules can be reused in other parts of the system or even in different systems.
- ✅ **Greater scalability and flexibility**: It's easier to add or remove features.

## Cons

---

# Inversion Of Control

---

# Dependency Injection
